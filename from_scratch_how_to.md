## Building a Decision Tree From Scratch

Creating a decision tree classifier from scratch helps deepen understanding of how these algorithms make decisions. Let's break down the core components of my implementation:

### 1. Tree Structure with Nodes

First, I created a `Node` class to represent each decision point in the tree:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, feature=None, threshold=None, left=None, right=None, value=None):
        self.feature = feature      # Feature to split on
        self.threshold = threshold  # Value for the split
        self.left = left            # Left child node
        self.right = right          # Right child node
        self.value = value          # For leaf nodes, stores the prediction
```

Each node either:
- Makes a decision (internal node) based on a feature and threshold
- Provides a classification (leaf node) through its value attribute

### 2. Information Theory Metrics

For deciding where to split, I implemented both Gini impurity and entropy calculations:

```python
def _gini(self, y):
    counts = np.bincount(y)
    probabilities = counts / len(y)
    return 1 - np.sum(probabilities ** 2)
    
def _entropy(self, y):
    counts = np.bincount(y)
    probabilities = counts / len(y)
    probabilities = probabilities[probabilities > 0]
    return -np.sum(probabilities * np.log2(probabilities))
```

These metrics measure how "mixed" the classes are, with:
- 0 representing a perfectly pure node (all samples belong to one class)
- Higher values indicating greater mix of classes

### 3. Finding the Best Split

The core of the algorithm is identifying where to split the data:

```python
def _best_split(self, X, y):
    best_split = {'feature': None, 'threshold': None, 'gain': -float('inf')}
    
    # For each feature
    for feature in range(X.shape[1]):
        # For each unique value of that feature
        for threshold in np.unique(X[:, feature]):
            # Split the data
            left_idxs = X[:, feature] <= threshold
            right_idxs = ~left_idxs
            
            # Calculate information gain
            gain = self._information_gain(y, y[left_idxs], y[right_idxs])
            
            # Update if this split is better
            if gain > best_split['gain']:
                best_split = {
                    'feature': feature,
                    'threshold': threshold,
                    'gain': gain,
                    'left_idxs': left_idxs,
                    'right_idxs': right_idxs
                }
    
    return best_split
```

This function tests every possible split on every feature, seeking the one that maximizes information gain.

### 4. Recursive Tree Building

The tree is built recursively, with each call creating a node in the tree:

```python
def _build_tree(self, X, y, depth=0):
    # Check stopping conditions
    if self._should_stop(depth, X, y):
        return Node(value=np.bincount(y).argmax())
    
    # Find the best split
    best_split = self._best_split(X, y)
    
    # Create children recursively
    left = self._build_tree(X[best_split['left_idxs']], y[best_split['left_idxs']], depth+1)
    right = self._build_tree(X[best_split['right_idxs']], y[best_split['right_idxs']], depth+1)
    
    # Return decision node
    return Node(
        feature=best_split['feature'],
        threshold=best_split['threshold'],
        left=left,
        right=right
    )
```

The recursive nature mirrors the hierarchical structure of the resulting tree.

### 5. Making Predictions

Finally, I implemented prediction by recursively traversing the tree:

```python
def _traverse_tree(self, x, node):
    # If we're at a leaf node, return its value
    if node.value is not None:
        return node.value
    
    # Otherwise, decide which child to go to
    if x[node.feature] <= node.threshold:
        return self._traverse_tree(x, node.left)
    else:
        return self._traverse_tree(x, node.right)
```

### 6. Implementation Challenges

While building this tree classifier, I encountered several challenges:

- **Handling edge cases**: Ensuring the algorithm works with various data distributions
- **Performance optimization**: The brute-force approach to finding splits can be computationally expensive
- **Memory management**: Recursive implementations can lead to stack overflow with deep trees
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Finding the right balance for `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, etc.

### 7. Results

As seen in my poker hand classification experiment, the custom tree matched scikit-learn's implementation in performance, achieving 100% accuracy with proper feature engineering.

### Key Takeaways

Building a decision tree from scratch revealed:

1. The beauty of the algorithm's simplicity - at its core, it's just recursive splitting
2. How critically important feature engineering is - with raw poker features, information gain was minimal (0.0005-0.0103)
3. With engineered features, information gain jumped dramatically (up to 0.43 at the root), allowing for a perfect classifier with just 10 leaf nodes
4. The direct relationship between feature quality and tree complexity - better features mean simpler trees

This implementation not only served as a learning exercise but also produced a fully functional classifier that can be used on real-world data.
